10^9 sites
10^6 input pairs
Computer can execute 10^9 instructions per second

The object initialization makes ~10^9 instructions (1 for initializing the count variable, 1 for creating the parents array
and 10^9 for initializing each parent)
Each find operation makes 1 instruction
Each union operation makes ~10^9 instructions (1 for each find(), 1 for comparing parents of the components being united, 
10^9 for comparing parents, 1 to 10^9 for updating parents and 1 for reducing the count of components)

For 10^6 input pairs, the total number of instructions required (I) is:
I = M x IU

Where M is the number of input pairs and IU is the number of instructions in the union operation.

I = 10^6 x 10^9
I = 10^15

Seconds needed = 10^15 / 10^9
Seconds needed = 10^6

10^6 seconds = 16,666 minutes = 277 hours = 11.5 days
