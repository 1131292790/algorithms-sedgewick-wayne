Maximum possible flow value for any st-network with V vertices and E edges (with positive integer capacities less than M):
Consider C to be the highest possible edge capacity.

1- Parallel edges not allowed
Max flow = (V - 2) * C
In this case, since parallel edges are not allowed, each vertex other than the source and the target is connected to them through 2 edges of capacity C.

2- Parallel edges allowed
Max flow = E * C
In this case, with parallel edges allowed, the source vertex can be directly connected to the target vertex through E parallel edges, each with capacity C.
