4.1.31 - Graph enumeration

There are (V) ways to choose a set {u, v} of two vertices. From this set there are E ways to choose the vertices to connect.
          (2)
So there are ((V)) = (V! / 2! * (V - 2)!)! / E! * ((V! / 2! * (V - 2)!) - E)!
             ((2))
             ( E )
different undirected graphs with V vertices and E edges (and no parallel edges).
