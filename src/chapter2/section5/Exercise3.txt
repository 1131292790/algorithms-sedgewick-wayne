2.5.3

The compareTo() is a flawed implementation of the Comparable interface because it violates the Comparable contract.
The contract says that if x.compareTo(y) == 0 then the sign of x.compareTo(z) must be equal to the sign of y.compareTo(z), for all z.
In the implementation described in the exercise, if x = 0.001, y = 0.005 and z = 0.007, the rule will be violated:
x.compareTo(y) will be equal to 0, x.compareTo(z) will have a negative sign and y.compareTo(z) will be equal to zero.

In other words, it is possible that x.compareTo(y) and y.compareTo(z) are both 0, but x.compareTo(z) is negative (or positive).
To fix this problem both "amount" variables should be compared directly:

if (this.amount < that.amount) return -1;
if (this.amount > that.amount) return +1;
return 0;
